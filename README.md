### GitHub dev server dotfiles

## Installation
Be sure you want to use the files in this repo, 
because this installation will overwrite the .zshrc file in the $HOME directory.

```shell
cd ~
git clone git@github.com:timreimherr/dotfiles .dotfiles
.dotfiles/install.sh
```
## Conventions
### Shell
These dotfiles assume you are using `zsh` as your shell.

### Theme
This configuration uses the `simple` oh-my-zsh theme.
